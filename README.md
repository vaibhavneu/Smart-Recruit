Using Machine Learning to recruit footballers

Every club needs a striker. For a striker to excel, his preferred playstyle and physical attributes must match the club tactics. Using data available on StatsBomb, I created a model that can sugest which strikers best fit the team according to chosen playstyle.

Researching the topic involved a thorough exploration of football analytics, specifically focusing on striker performance metrics. I collected and analyzed data from StatsBomb, identifying key playstyle indicators and physical attributes crucial for strikers. The integration of this model aids clubs in recruiting strikers aligned with their tactical preferences, optimizing team performance and strategy.

The final outcome demonstrates the successful implementation of a robust xG model using Gradient Boosting, providing a reliable tool for clubs to assess and recruit strikers tailored to their playstyle. The high accuracy achieved (92%) underscores the effectiveness of the approach, contributing valuable insights to enhance decision-making in football player recruitment.

Phase 1 includes the implementation of the main xG model using Grdaient Boosting Classifier.
Phase 2 deals mostly with the hyperparameter optimisation and the accuracy metrics of the model.
